Pixcheck the pixel testing software for stuck dead and strange pixels



# types of pixels


## stuck pixel

A stuck pixel is a pixels that is one colour and displays on the screen as a mismatching dot this software can help with those types of pixels but sometimes they cant be fixed.

## dead pixels

Pixels like stuck pixels but show as a black pixel no matter what.

## strange pixel

this one is rare but can still happen a strange pixel is a piel that only shows when a colour or white is near it it can be red green or blue but most of the time its red it only shows in specific situations and when you test with a completely black screen or one colour it isnt there unless its sourrounded by other pixels of white or colour and in most cases if you set it to the colour of the pixel it will show black.

THIS IS A HARDWARE DEFECT AND IS NOT FIXABLE WITH ANY SOFTWARE CALL YOUR MANUFACTURE.
